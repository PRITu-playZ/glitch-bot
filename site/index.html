	<h2> Our Team </h2>
	<p>At the moment we are a team of 2 but when it's needed we will search for another person.</p>
	<hr />
	<h2> The Bot </h2>
	<p>This bot is created, because we like it. We will listen to feedback, but we will not make people command us to add a
		feature.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h2> Applications </h2>
	<p>For now we will stick with a team of two developers, but when the time comes we will be searching for new developers</p>
